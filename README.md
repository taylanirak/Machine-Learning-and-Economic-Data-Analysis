# Machine-Learning-and-Economic-Data-Analysis
Description

This project involves applying machine learning techniques to analyze and predict trends based on economic and financial datasets. The datasets include information such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI), GDP, unemployment rates, and stock market data. The project makes use of Python and machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn for data preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.
